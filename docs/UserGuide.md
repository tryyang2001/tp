After setting up the profile, you can start recording your food and exercises with the commands below.


## **3. Terminology**

***Calorie*** - A unit used to measure the energy of an item. One calorie is the amount of energy required to raise the
temperature of one gram of water by one degree Celsius. On average, a male will require approximately 2500 cal consumed
from food per day while a female will require around 2000 cal intake per day.\
\
***Calorie goal*** - The amount of calorie you wish to achieve per day. It is the value you want to achieve from your 
calorie intake minus the calorie burnt naturally and physically per day. If you are planning to lose weight, it is 
recommended to set your daily calorie goal as negative value. On the other hand, positive value calorie goal may mean that 
you are going to increase or maintain your body weight.

***Net Calorie*** - The difference between calorie goal and the total calorie burnt from exercising and 
[body metabolism](https://www.news-medical.net/life-sciences/What-is-Metabolism.aspx).
For your information, we use [basal metabolic rate (BMR)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_metabolic_rate) to compute
the rate of calorie consumed by body metabolic activity.\
\
***Activity factor*** - A measure of the level of activity. The value is used in the calculation of BMR. In our application, 
we use an integer ranged from 1 to 5 to measure the activity factor:
- Integer 1: Little to no exercise (0-1 day of exercises a week)
- Integer 2: Lightly active (1-3 days of exercises a week)
- Integer 3: Moderately active (3-5 days of exercises a week)
- Integer 4: Very active (6-7 days of exercises a week)
- Integer 5: Extremely active (when sports is your passion and have a very physical job scope)

***Body Mass Index (BMI)*** - A measure to evaluate if the body weight is healthy. BMI is computed by using the body
weight(in kg) divided by the square of the body height(in m). \
\
***Item*** - We use the term _Item_ to represent the items that can be stored in _Fitbot_. The available items
are _Food Item_ and _Exercise Item_.\
\
***Upcoming exercise*** - We define the exercise with date after today's date as an Upcoming Exercise. This kind of exercise
will be handled specifically. It will not be added to the Exercise List but will be saved internally in the storage file. More
details of the process can be found at [here](#442-adding-recurring-exercise-items-add-r).\
\
***Item Bank*** - An item storage that is capable of storing the Food or Exercise Item with its respective calorie. This is
to help you to store the calorie intake of a specific Food or the calorie burnt from a specific Exercise for future use. More details
of the item bank can be found at [here](#451-adding-food-bank-items-add-fbank).\
\
***Parameters*** - Parameters are values in the command format that _Fitbot_ expects you to provide.


## **4. Features**

ℹ️ ***Command Format***


- Commands are not case-sensitive (e.g. `help`, `HELP`,`hElP` are all able to execute the `help` command)

- Words in upper case (e.g. `UPPER_CASE`) are used to signify parameters.

- Parameters in curly brackets `{}` are optional.

  e.g. `bmi {h/HEIGHT_IN_CM w/WEIGHT_IN_KG}` can be `bmi` or `bmi h/150 w/70`

- The order of the parameters do not matter.

  e.g. `add f/potato c/200` or `add c/200 f/potato` both adds a Food Item called "potato" with 200 calories.


❗ Please do not use the characters `/` and `|` in your input other than to specify parameters!


### **4.1 Customising Your Profile**

You can customise your profile with the following steps.

#### 4.1.1 Setting Up Your Profile

Refer to [2. Set Up Profile](#2-set-up-profile) to set up your profile.

#### 4.1.2 Viewing Profile: `profile`

Typing `profile` lets you view your name, height, weight, gender, age, calorie goal and activity factor.

Example:

```text
profile 
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
Hello Lisa! This is your profile: 
*====================================== 
	Height 			159cm 
	Weight 			50.0kg 
	Gender 			F 
	Age 			21 
	Calories goal 		1500 cal 
	Activity factor 	2 
======================================* 
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________ 
```
#### 4.1.3 Updating Profile Attributes 

Change your profile attributes with the following command: \
`profile {n/NAME} {h/HEIGHT} {w/WEIGHT} {s/GENDER} {a/AGE} {g/CALORIE_GOAL} {x/ACTIVITY_FACTOR}` \
\
where : 
\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; n/ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; name \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; h/ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; height in cm \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; w/ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;weight in kg \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; a/ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; age \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; g/ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; calorie goal \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; s/ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; gender (M or F) \
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; x/ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; activity factor (1: Sedentary - 5: Extremely Active)

where you will require at least 1 of the optional parameters (in no particular order) to change your attribute!

#### 4.1.4 Calculating BMI `bmi`

You can calculate your Body Mass Index (BMI) using the command `bmi {h/HEIGHT_IN_CM} {w/WEIGHT_IN_KG}`

If you do not provide the two optional parameters of height and weight, the BMI will be computed based on the user's current height and weight in the profile. It also outputs the status of your BMI *(underweight, healthy, overweight, obese)* based on the calculated BMI.

Example:
- `bmi` calculates the BMI value based on the user's height and weight in his or her profile.
- `bmi h/170 w/65` calculates the BMI value based on height 170cm and weight 65cm.

```text  
bmi
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Your BMI value according to your current profile is:
	15.5 (Underweight)
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________
bmi h/170 w/65  
__________________________________________________________________________________________  
The calculated BMI value is 20.1 (Healthy)
__________________________________________________________________________________________  
```  

### **4.2 Recording your food consumption**

You can record all the food items consumed within a week into the Food List. This allows you
to keep track of your food calorie consumption and gain a better understanding of your diet habit. 

#### 4.2.1 Adding Food Items `add f/`

You can record food items consumed on a specific date and time with a specific calorie value into the Food List. 
This command allows you to add a new Food Item to the Food List.

Format: `add f/ITEM {c/CALORIES} {d/DD-MM-YYYY} {t/HHMM}` adds a Food Item consumed with its respective calories on the given
date (`DD-MM-YYYY`) and time (`HHMM`).

Example: 
- `add f/chicken rice c/607 d/21-10-2021 t/1400` adds record of food consumed: chicken rice with 607 calories gained on 21 Oct 2021 1400 to the food list.

```text
add f/chicken rice c/607 d/21-10-2021 t/1400
__________________________________________________________________________________________
A food item has been added:
    chicken rice (607 cal) @ 14:00, 21 Oct 2021
__________________________________________________________________________________________
```
💡 **Tip:** If you do not specify the date and time of the Food Item, it is assumed that the date and time is based on the date and time of input.

💡 **Tip:** It is possible to add Food Item without providing the calorie of it. You can do this by saving the corresponding 
Food Item into the Food Bank. More details can be found at [Section 4.5](#45-building-your-food-bank).

❗ The input date `DD-MM-YYYY` must within 7 days before today. For example, if today date is `20-10-2021`, then the input
date must be within `13-10-2021` to `20-10-2021`.

#### 4.2.2 Viewing Food List `view f/`

You may want to view how many calories you have taken in this week. This command will show a list of Food Items and 
their calories added within 7 days (including today) from the list.

Format: `view f/`

Example: 

```text
view f/
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Here is a summary of all the food items you have consumed in the past week:
..........................................................................................................
You have consumed 3 food item(s) on Friday (22 Oct 2021):

..........................................................................................................
Total number of food consumed in this week: 7
Total calories consumed in this week: 3425 cal
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________
```

#### 4.2.3 Deleting Food Items `delete f/`

When you mistakenly add a wrong Food Item inside your Food List, there is no need to worry! This command allows you to 
remove a specific Food Item in the Food List.

Format: `delete f/LIST_NO d/DD-MM-YYYY t/HHMM` deletes the *n<sup>th</sup>* Food Item in the Food List which has the date (`DD-MM-YYYY`)
and time (`HHMM`), where *n* is the index of the Food to delete.

❗ `LIST_NO` must be a positive integer within the range of the number of Items in the list.


Example:

```text
delete f/1 d/22-10-2021 t/1000
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________
A food item has been deleted:
	donut x2 (607 cal) @ 10:00, 22 Oct 2021
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________
```
💡  **Tip:** If you wish to remove all the Food Items from the list, there is a shortcut command: `delete f/all`.
```
delete f/all
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________
All food items have been removed.
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________
```

### **4.3 Recording Your Exercises**

Besides Food Items, you may also record Exercises that you have taken into the Exercise List. This will allow you to keep
track of total calories burnt and check whether you have done sufficient exercises. 

#### 4.3.1 Adding Exercise Items `add e/`

By using this command, you can add any Exercise Items done into the Exercise List.

Format: `add e/ITEM {c/CALORIES} {d/DD-MM-YYYY}` adds an Exercise Item with its respective calories burnt on the given date
(`DD-MM-YYYY`).

ℹ️ If the date `DD-MM-YYYY` provided is in the future, this exercise will be treated as an Upcoming Exercise Item, 
and it will be added to the [Upcoming Exercise List](#441-adding-upcoming-exercise-items-add-e) instead.

💡 **Tip:** Similar to [Food Item](#421-adding-food-items-add-f), if you do not specify the date and time of the Exercise Item, 
it is assumed that the date and time is based on the date and time of input.

💡 **Tip:** It is possible to add Exercise Item without providing the calorie burnt on it. You can do this by saving the corresponding
Exercise Item into the Exercise Bank. More details can be found at [here](#46-building-your-exercise-bank).

❗ The input date `DD-MM-YYYY` must within 7 days before today. For example, if today date is `20-10-2021`, then the input
date must be within `13-10-2021` to `20-10-2021`.

Example:
- `add e/hiit c/290 d/21-10-2021` adds record of exercise done: hiit with 290 calories burnt on 21 Oct 2021 to the Exercise List.

```text
add e/hiit c/290 d/21-10-2021

### **4.5. Building your Food Bank**
Do you have certain dishes or snacks that you frequently consume? Instead of having to key in their calories everytime you want to
record them into the Food List, you can add it into the Food Bank once so that the next time you want to record this item in the Food List,
you would only have to provide the name of the item!

#### 4.5.1 Adding Food Bank Items `add fbank/`
You can add a Food Item into the Food Bank using this command.

Format: `add fbank/ITEM c/CALORIES`
```
add fbank/McSpicy Meal c/1081 
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________
A food item has been added to the food bank:
	McSpicy Meal (1081 cal)
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________
```

❗️ The Food Bank cannot have duplicate item names as _Fitbot_ needs to be able to uniquely identify the item calories. Note that
the match for item name is **case-insensitive**. For example, if an item named `potato` already exists in the Food Bank, an item named `POTATO` also cannot be added in.

After adding the item to the Food Bank, you can now add the item into the Food List whenever you want without specifying the calories. 
Simply provide the name of the item and _Fitbot_ will search up the corresponding calorie value for the item with the same name for you from the Food Bank! As before, note that the matching of names is 
**case-insensitive**.

```
add f/mcspicy meal
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________
A food item has been added:
mcspicy meal (1081 cal) @ 02:32, 29 Oct 2021
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________
```

#### 4.5.2 Viewing Food Bank `view fbank/`
You can view all the Items in the Food Bank using this command.

Format: `view fbank/`

```
view fbank/
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________
You have 2 food(s) in your food bank:
	1. Baked Potato (300 cal)
	2. McSpicy Meal (1081 cal)
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________
```

#### 4.5.3 Editing Food Bank Items `edit fbank/`
If you have entered any wrong information or wish to update existing Items in the Food Bank, you can use this command to do so.

Format:  `edit fbank/LIST_NO. {n/NEW_NAME} {c/NEW_CALORIES}` edits the n<sup>th</sup> Item in the Food Bank, where *n* is the index of the Food Item to edit.

❗ `LIST_NO` must be a positive integer within the range of the number of Items in the list.

Example:
```
edit fbank/1 c/350
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Item number 1 in the food bank has been changed to:
	Baked Potato (350 cal)
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________

```

❗️ Though the parameters are optional, do provide at least one of them so that _Fitbot_ knows what you want to update about the Item! 

#### 4.5.4 Deleting Food Bank Items `delete fbank/`
You can delete an Item from the Food Bank using this command.

Format: `edit fbank/LIST_NO.` deletes the n<sup>th</sup> Item in the Food Bank, where *n* is the index of the Food Item to edit.

❗ `LIST_NO` must be a positive integer within the range of the number of Items in the list.

Example:
```
delete fbank/2
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________
A food item has been deleted from the food bank:
	McSpicy Meal (1081 cal) @ 02:25
Number of food item(s) left in the food bank: 1
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________
```

💡   **Tip:** If you wish to remove all the Food Items from the Food Bank, there is a shortcut command: `delete fbank/all`.


### **4.6. Building your Exercise Bank**
Have a standard workout routine that you use? You can add it into the Exercise Bank for _Fitbot_ to remember the amount of calories you 
burn from it!



#### 4.6.1 Adding Exercise Bank Items `add ebank/`
You can add an Exercise Item into the Exercise Bank using this command.

Format: `add ebank/ITEM c/CALORIES`
```
add ebank/30 min jog c/450
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________
An exercise item has been added to the exercise bank:
	30 min jog (450 cal)
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________
```

❗️ The Exercise Bank cannot have duplicate item names as _Fitbot_ needs to be able to uniquely identify the item calories. Note that
the match for item name is **case-insensitive**. For example, if an item named `jogging` already exists in the Exercise Bank, an item named `Jogging` also cannot be added in.

Similar to the Food Bank, after adding the item to the Exercise Bank, the next time you want to add this item to your Exercise List, you can just provide its name
and _Fitbot_ will search up the corresponding calorie value for the item with the same name for you from the Exercise Bank! As before, note that the matching of names is
**case-insensitive**.

```
add e/30 min jog
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________
An exercise item has been added:
	30 min jog (450 cal) @ 29 Oct 2021
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________
```



Format: `edit u/LIST_NO {n/NEW_NAME} {c/NEW_CALORIES} {d/NEW_DATE}` edits the n<sup>th</sup> item in the Upcoming Exercise List, where *n* is the index of the Exercise to edit.

❗ `LIST_NO` must be a positive integer within the range of the number of Items in the list.

#### 4.6.2 Viewing Exercise Bank `view ebank/`
You can view all the Items in the Exercise Bank using this command.


Format: `view ebank/`

```
view ebank/
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________
You have 1 exercise(s) in your exercise bank:
	1. 30 min jog (450 cal)
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________

```


#### 4.6.3 Editing Exercise Bank Items `edit ebank/`
If you have entered any wrong information or wish to update existing Items in the Exercise Bank, you can use this command to do so.

Format:  `edit ebank/LIST_NO. {n/NEW_NAME} {c/NEW_CALORIES}` edits the n<sup>th</sup> Item in the Exercise Bank, where *n* is the index of the Exercise Item to edit.

❗ `LIST_NO` must be a positive integer within the range of the number of Items in the list.

Example:


``` 
edit ebank/1 n/35 min jog
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Item number 1 in the exercise bank has been changed to:
	35 min jog (450 cal)
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________

```
❗️ Though the parameters are optional, do provide at least one of them so that _Fitbot_ knows what you want to update about the Item!


#### 4.6.4 Deleting Exercise Bank Items `delete ebank/`
You can delete an Item from the Exercise Bank using this command.

Format: `delete ebank/LIST_NO.` deletes the n<sup>th</sup> Item in the Exercise Bank, where *n* is the index of the Exercise Item to edit.

❗ `LIST_NO` must be a positive integer within the range of the number of Items in the list.

Example:
```
delete ebank/1
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________
An exercise item has been deleted from the exercise bank:
	35 min jog (450 cal)
Number of exercise item(s) left in the exercise bank: 0
__________________________________________________________________________________________________________

### **5. Data Management**


#### 5.1. Saving The Data

There is no need to save manually. Any updates made to the data will be automatically stored into the local drive and reloaded when _Fitbot_ is restarted.

#### 5.2 Editing The Data File

_Fitbot_ data files are saved as .text files `<JAR file location>/data/<text file name>.txt`. \
Advanced users are welcome to update data directly by editing the data files. 

❗ If your changes to the data files format are invalid, _Fitbot_ will skip the wrongly formatted line when it loads in the data.

❗ Ensure that you quit _Fitbot_ if you would like to edit the files. Edits made directly to files when _Fitbot_ is running will not be saved.

### **6. FAQ**

**Q:** How do I transfer my data to another computer?\
**A:** Zip the folder with _Fitbot_ and its data files, and transfer to the new computer. Extract the zipped folder onto your new computer and follow steps 1, 4 and 5 in [Quick Start](#1-quick-start) to get your _Fitbot_ running on your new computer.

**Q:** How many profiles can I create?\
**A:** _Fitbot_ only supports 1 profile. If you need to make any changes to your current profile, you can refer to [Updating Profile Attributes](#413-updating-profile-attributes).

**Q:**  Why does _Fitbot_ need so many personal particulars?\
**A:** _Fitbot_ needs your height, weight, age, gender and activity factor so that we can calculate your [BMR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basal_metabolic_rate).
Calorie goal is required to help you check how close or how far you are away from your calorie goal.
_Fitbot_ needs to know your name to address you.
